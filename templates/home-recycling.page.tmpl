        <p class="subheading3">Upcycling: Transform old or unused items into something new and useful. For example, you can turn glass jars into candle holders, or use old t-shirts to make reusable shopping bags.<br><br>

            Composting: Create a compost pile or use a compost bin to recycle organic waste such as food scraps, coffee grounds, and yard trimmings into nutrient-rich compost for your garden.<br><br>
            
            E-waste recycling: Recycle old electronics like phones, computers, and batteries responsibly. Many communities have drop-off locations or recycling programs specifically for electronic waste.<br><br>
            
            Clothing and textile recycling: Donate gently used clothing to thrift stores or charitable organizations. Old clothing that can't be donated can be repurposed into cleaning rags or recycled into new textiles.<br><br>
            
            Paper recycling: Collect and recycle paper and cardboard materials. Many municipalities offer curbside recycling programs for paper products, or you can reuse paper for crafts or packing material before recycling.</p>
